# django-api

*Built on Django 2.2 and Python3*

Django REST framework is a powerful and flexible toolkit for building Web APIs.

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine
2. Ensure you have run `pip install Django` and `pip install djangorestframework`. 
3. `cd` into the directory of your project.
4. Run `python manage.py runserver` 

In the admin section, you can add, delete and view songs in the DB
The index page points to the endpoint URL of the API. It leads to the songs in JSON format. 
There is a POST method using which you can add _songs_ and it will get reflected in the app. 

URLs:
<local host>/admin
<local host>/songs
<local host>
